<h1>Project	Summary:</h1>

    This project is an encription librabary ment to take strings and make them more protected from unwanted viewers at the moment it primarilly shuffels ASCII values 

<h1>How	to	Run:</h1>

When you initilize the Encription class, you have two options:
<ol>
    <li>(int keylength, string yourMessage), this will make a random key of the length specified I recomend a key 10-30% as long as the message</li>
    <li>(string yourKey, string yourMessage), this alows for you to put in your own custom string, either to speed up decription or to put weird characters in your key, any ASCII character will work</li> 
</ol>

After you have the Encription initilized you can:
<ul>
<li>call the decrypt() function with a key to try and extract a string that makes sense</li>
<li>call the encrypt() function to encript your message with the curent key</li>
<li>call getstring() to get the current state of the message</li>
<li>call getkey() to get the curent key</li>
<li>call generatekey(int keyLength) to generate a new random key of that length (WARNING: this will replace the old key)</li>
<li>call manualkey(string key) to change the key to what you entered, works for all ASCII characters (WARNING: this will replace the old key)</li>
</ul>
